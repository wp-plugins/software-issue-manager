Software Issue Manager allows to track the progress and resolution of every project issue in a productive and efficient way.

== Description ==
Software Issue Manager(SIM) is a project based bug, issue, task and product feature request tracking system with extensive built-in and custom reporting capabilities. Premium editions are available.

If you need ticket management system, try our [WP Ticket plugin.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ticket/)

Issues are the items you would like to track in your projects. Issues could be tasks, feature requests, bugs or pretty much any thing you need related to your projects.

SIM Projects are identified by a name and a version number. Projects may have unlimited number of issues. Issues can be shared by multiple projects. Community version supports "open" projects which do not require participants to login to WordPress. Premium versions limit access to content by user's role and are appropriate for "closed" projects which require users to login to access content.
